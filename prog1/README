List.java

 List.java contains a double linked List data structure specified to handle integer
 inputs. It exists to allow the storing of information and allow ease in sort in
 as this information is added.

ListClient.java
 
 Supplied by Professor Tantalo, this class exists to test the functionality and performance
 of the List ADT by acting as a test harness and providing a set of known inputs and outputs
 to various List functions to confirm intended functionality is exhibited.

Lex.java
 
 Written by Ryan Brounley, this file accepts two arguments (one filled with strings) and the other for an  output file. It writes the strings into an array and then it runs my Ryan Connors, (ID: XXXXXX)

List.java

 List.java is a doubly linked list ADT module that is contains many different function to manipulate
 and Access the node/List constructors. It is used throughly in testing by ListClient and used to 
 sort the string array in Lex lexographically.

ListClient.java
 
 Supplied by Professor Tantalo, this class exists to test the functionality and performance
 of the List ADT.

Lex.java
 
 Written by Ryan Brounley, it takes two args and sorts one into a string array and then runs it through my lexSort function which uses the ADT module of List.java to sort the strings by their indecies into 
 lexographic order.
 
Makefile
