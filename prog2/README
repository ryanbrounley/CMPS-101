List.c

 List.c is a doubly linked list ADT module that is contains many different function to manipulate
 and Access the node/List constructors. It is used throughly in testing by ListClient and used to 
 sort the string array in Lex lexographically.

ListClient.c
 
 Supplied by Professor Tantalo, this class exists to test the functionality and performance
 of the List ADT.

Lex.c
 
 Written by Ryan Brounley, it takes two args and sorts one into a string array and then runs it through my lexSort function which uses the ADT module of List.java to sort the strings by their indecies into 
 lexographic order.
 
List.h
 
 Written by Ryan Brounley, contains all of the methods in List.c. Connects all of the methods from List.c t the other methods in the Lex and ListClient.
