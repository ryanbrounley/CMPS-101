Sparse Matrix
---------------------------------
Included Files:
---------------------------------
List.java

 List.java is a doubly linked list ADT module that is contains many different function to manipulate
 and Access the node/List constructors. The list contains objects as specified in the Matrix ADT containing
 columns and values. 

ListTest.java
 
 Similar to the ListClient supplied by Professor Tantalo, this class exists to test the functionality and performance
 of the List ADT.

Matrix.java
 
 Written by Ryan Brounley, this file contains the Matrix ADT which has all of the manipulation and access features that 
 create and scalar,add,sub,transpose,and mult the matrix 
 
MatrixTest.java

 This is a modified version of the MatrixClient which contains more functions that show that the ADT methods actually
 do what they are supposed to do. I edited this as I was making Matrix ADT so it tests harshly to ensure my code was correct

Sparse.java

 This is the file that makes the two matrices and prints out the output from the assignment prompt. It writes the output into a  from a file in args[1] and into a file in args[2]

Makefile

  The makefile contains the full running commanding to compile all of the classes together. Given to 
  us by Professor Tantalo.
